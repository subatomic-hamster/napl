# Parts database

One TOML file per real, purchasable part: `parts/<domain>/<id>.toml` (`domain` = `drone`, `arm`,
`common`). Parts are facts about real hardware; every number must be traceable.

## Ports (interfaces for snapping, wiring and design-rule checks)

Every part that connects to anything declares its interfaces. The builder snaps parts together
by mating compatible ports; the design-rule checker (DRC) uses port ratings.

```toml
[[ports]]
name = "base"                          # unique within the part
kind = "mech"                          # mech | power | signal
type = "bolt-pattern.16x16.m3"         # interface family (see table below)
gender = "female"                      # male | female | neutral (mech holes = neutral)
pos = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]                  # m, part frame
axis = [0.0, 0.0, -1.0]                # unit outward normal: mating parts face opposite axes
ref = [1.0, 0.0, 0.0]                  # unit in-plane reference (orientation about axis)
symmetry = 4                           # n-fold rotations about axis that still fit
thickness = 0.002                      # m of material clamped at this port (fastener stack)

[[ports]]
name = "power_in"
kind = "power"
type = "xt60"                          # connector family
gender = "male"
v_max = { value = 25.2, unit = "V", src = "S1", fidelity = "datasheet" }
i_max = { value = 60.0, unit = "A", src = "S1", fidelity = "datasheet" }   # continuous
role = "sink"                          # source | sink | passthrough

[[ports]]
name = "bus"
kind = "signal"
type = "feetech-ttl"                   # pwm | dshot | uart | i2c | can | feetech-ttl | usb
gender = "female"
level = { value = 5.0, unit = "V", src = "S1", fidelity = "datasheet" }
```

**Lead flag (`lead`, power / signal ports).** A part whose datasheet mass already includes a cable permanently attached to a port
(the pack's XT60 lead, a motor's phase leads, a GPS cable) marks that port machine-readably:

```toml
[[ports]]
name = "power_out"
kind = "power"
# ...
lead = { length = "discharge_wire_length", awg = "discharge_wire_awg" }   # both optional; `lead = {}` = flag only
```

`length` / `awg` are each either the name of a numeric param of the same part (preferred: it keeps the provenance) or an inline
provenance table `{ value, unit, fidelity, ... }`; a param name the part lacks is an error at autowire time. Effect: `autowire` /
`autowire_all` set `included_in` to that instance on any wire ending on the port (no `included_in` argument needed), use the lead's
length instead of the routed one (warning when the routed run is longer), and, when `awg` is given and the library has a wire part
with that `awg`, use that wire. Only mark a port whose cable mass really is inside the part's `mass`.

Every `mech` port must have `ref` (unit vector perpendicular to `axis`) and `symmetry` (integer >= 1); `tools/check_parts.py`
enforces it, because snapping needs both. Round shafts (`shaft.<d>`, `prop_adapter`) are axisymmetric: `symmetry = 360`, any
`ref`. Prop hubs (`bore.<d>`): `ref` along a blade, `symmetry = 1` (the prop spins freely, the builder uses a hinge).

Mate compatibility: same `type` (or the paired families `shaft.<d>` / `bore.<d>` and `tube.<od>` / `tube-clamp.<od>` of
the same size), and genders male+female or either neutral. Two mated mech
ports coincide in position, have opposite axes, and their `ref`s align up to the `symmetry`
rotations. Interface families in use (extend as needed, keep names stable):

| type | meaning |
|---|---|
| `bolt-pattern.<a>x<b>.<thread>` | rectangular hole pattern, centre-to-centre mm (e.g. 16x16.m3, 30.5x30.5.m3) |
| `bolt-circle.<d>.<n>.<thread>` | n holes on a d-mm circle |
| `shaft.<d>` / `bore.<d>` | round shaft (male) and matching bore (female), mm; these two types mate each other |
| `tube.<od>` / `tube-clamp.<od>` | tube and the clamp that holds it, mm; these two types mate each other (the X500 files use `tube.<od>` male/female on both sides) |
| `flat-mount` | board or body lying on a face, no hole pattern (tape / strap / foam seat), neutral |
| `bolt-pattern.x500v2-arm-clamp.m3` | X500 V2 arm-connector clamp footprint: 4 M3 through-bolts (hole positions not recorded), thread from the `thread` key; used between plates and arm connectors |
| `mount.x500v2-landing-gear` | X500 V2 landing-gear pole-top seat under the bottom plate (placeholder: no hole pattern, hardware not modelled) |
| `servo-horn.<spline>` | servo output spline (e.g. 25t) |
| `thread.<m>` | single threaded hole or stud (fastener seat) |
| `xt30`, `xt60`, `xt90`, `jst-gh.<n>`, `jst-ph.<n>`, `servo-3pin`, `solder-pad` | connectors |

Fidelity tags:
- `datasheet`: stated by the manufacturer/vendor for this exact part.
- `literature`: peer-reviewed or well-known reference measurement of this part or exact model.
- `measured`: independent test data of this exact part (e.g. public thrust-stand logs).
- `derived`: computed from other sourced values; `derivation` required.
- `estimated`: nothing published; `rationale` required (cite the closest evidence).

Rules: no value without `src` unless `derived`/`estimated`; quotes are verbatim so a verifier can
re-fetch the page and find them; never invent a URL. Unit conversions from the source (g to kg,
kg*cm to N*m) are fine under the original fidelity tag and should be noted in the quote context.

## Connectors and pins (`[[connectors]]`, `[[connectors.pins]]`)

A `[[ports]]` entry is one logical interface; a `[[connectors]]` entry is one physical connector with every pin it has. Wiring
diagrams (2D canvas, DRC) and the 3D cables use the pins, so a part that is wired should list its real pinout from its datasheet or
schematic, however complex (the Pi 5 has the full 40-pin J8 header with every alternate function, two 22-pin FPC camera ports, four USB
ports, USB-C power). `tools/pinout_todo.py` lists the electrical parts that still have none.

```toml
[[connectors]]
id = "J8"                              # unique within the part; wire ends read "pi.J8.8"
name = "40-pin GPIO header"
type = "header-2x20-2.54mm"            # physical connector family
port_type = "csi"                      # optional: the logical family when it differs from `type` (used by synthetic ports)
gender = "male"
pos = [-0.01, 0.0245, 0.0136]          # m, part frame: centre of the pin field, on the mating face
axis = [0.0, 0.0, 1.0]                 # unit outward direction: the cable leaves along it (the 3D router honours this)
ref = [1.0, 0.0, 0.0]                  # unit direction along a row (pin 1 -> pin 2 side)
rows = 2                               # pin grid; pitch in m
cols = 20
pitch = 0.00254
layout = "dual"                        # dual (odd pins on one row, even on the other; default for rows = 2) | line | seq
src = "S4"                             # provenance of the connector; its pins inherit it unless they carry their own
fidelity = "literature"                # datasheet | literature | measured | derived | estimated (derivation / rationale as elsewhere)
pins = [
  { number = 1, name = "3V3", kind = "power", dir = "out", v = 3.3 },
  { number = 8, name = "GPIO14", kind = "signal", dir = "io", v = 3.3, i_max = 0.016, alt = ["a0:PWM0[2]", "a4:UART0_TX"] },
  { number = 9, name = "GND", kind = "ground" },
  { number = "A4", name = "VBUS", kind = "power", dir = "in", v_min = 4.75, v_max = 5.25, offset = [-0.0024, 0.0005] },
]
```

Pin keys: `number` (unique per connector, string or int; wires address `CONNECTOR.number`), `name`, `kind` (`power` | `ground` | `signal` |
`nc`), `dir` seen from the part (`out` = a power pin supplies / a signal pin drives, `in` = consumes / listens, `io`), `v` (the nominal
level it drives or expects), `v_min` / `v_max` (the range a sink accepts), `i_max` (A), `alt` (alternate functions of a multiplexed pin,
`"aN:FUNCTION"`), and the position when the pin is not on the regular grid: `at = [row, col]` (grid slot) or `offset = [x, y]` (m, in
the connector frame). A pin may carry its own provenance (`src`, `fidelity`, `derivation` / `rationale`). A value the source does not
state is left out, never invented; the connector must carry `src` + `fidelity` (derived needs `derivation`, estimated `rationale`).

`joinable = true` (connector key, default false) marks a bare lead, solder pad or screw terminal, where several conductors may be joined
on one pin (a Y-splice onto a battery lead, two wires soldered to one pad): `PIN_ALREADY_USED` then ignores that connector's pins, as it
already does for ground pins. Plugs and headers (XT30, JST, pin headers) are never joinable: one contact takes one conductor. Where a part's
pinout is not published, the connector says so (`fidelity = "estimated"` / `"derived"` with the rationale: which standard or sibling
product the pin order follows); a pin the source does not show is not listed.

**Ports and pins.** A port lists the pins it stands for: `pins = ["J8.8", "J8.10", "J8.6"]` (connector.pin). A connector pin that no port
claims becomes part of a synthetic port named after the connector (lower case, `synthetic = true`, family `port_type` or `type`), so
every pin is reachable without writing a port for it. `python/napl/design/pins.py` is the loader (`connectors(part)`, `port_pins`).

**Wires.** In an assembly (`assemblies/README.md`, "Wires") a wire may list `from_pins` / `to_pins` (one per conductor, in order) beside
the port-level `from` / `to`, or use the shorthand `from = "pi.J8.8"` for one conductor, which the loader folds into the port plus pin
lists. A port-level wire with no pin lists resolves to the pins its two ports list when the counts match. Pins add no mass and do not
change the physics: designs that were wired by ports keep their mass and hashes.

**Voltage semantics.** `v` is the level a pin drives or nominally expects; `v_min` / `v_max` is the range a sink accepts. The DRC
(`PIN_VOLTAGE_MISMATCH`) compares a driving pin's `v` with the sink's range (above `v_max` an error, below `v_min` a warning); two pins
without ranges must agree within max(0.5 V, 10 %).

## Mirroring (`[mirror]`) and price

A part used inside a mirrored sub-assembly (`[[subassemblies]] mirror = "xz"`) must say how its mirror image is made:

```toml
[mirror]
symmetry = "xz"        # the part is symmetric about this LOCAL plane ("xy" | "yz" | "xz"): the copy is the same part.
                       # Every port used in a mirrored mate must lie on that plane (position in it, axis and ref in it or normal to it).
# or
opposite = "bracket-left"   # the opposite-hand part (printed left/right brackets): its ports are this part's ports reflected in `plane`
plane    = "xz"             # default "xz": the local plane the pair is mirrored in
```

A part with neither is the DRC error `MIRROR_UNSUPPORTED`; a wrong claim is caught when the design builds (the mirrored sub-assembly
must equal the reflection of the unmirrored one). `tools/check_parts.py` validates the table.

`price` (optional param, unit `USD`, provenance like every param) is what the BOM sums; other currencies stay as `price_<cur>` records
and the USD `price` states the conversion (`derived`, with the assumed rate and date).

## Visual layer (`[visual]`, cosmetic only)

`[geometry]` stays the physics shape (collision, mass, inertia). `[visual]` says what the part *looks like* in the viewer,
renders, thumbnails and videos; it never feeds physics and its values carry no fidelity tag (they are excluded from the
fidelity tally: `tools/check_parts.py` counts only params / tables / ports). The builder (`napl.design.build`) emits every
visual element as a zero-density, non-colliding mesh geom (`mass="0" contype="0" conaffinity="0"`, same geom group as the plain
shape) with a MuJoCo `<material>`, and makes the plain `[geometry]` shape fully transparent (alpha 0; it still collides and
carries the mass). Meshes are generated at build time into `<out_dir>/visuals/` (content-addressed STL, never committed).
`build(..., visual=False)` / `compute(..., visual=False)` skips the layer; assemblies simulate bit-identically either way.

```toml
[visual]
src = "V1"                          # [[sources]] id of the appearance reference (product page / photo), or `rationale = "..."`
note = "black anodised bell, blue base ring (product photo)"   # free text: what was copied from the photo

[[visual.elements]]                 # one element = one generator or one mesh file; several elements stack
gen = "bldc_outrunner"              # family generator (python/napl/design/visuals/gens_*.py), or: mesh = "meshes/x.stl"
params = { vents = false }          # generator arguments; "param:NAME" takes the part's own params.NAME.value. Dimensions
                                    # (diameter, length_body, length / width / height ...) are read from [params] / [geometry]
pos = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]               # optional placement in the part frame (default per generator, see below)
zaxis = [0.0, 0.0, 1.0]             # optional: shortest-arc rotation taking +z to this axis (or rpy = [r, p, y], radians)
colors = { bell = "alu-anodised-black", base = [0.05, 0.5, 0.85] }   # slot -> material name or [r, g, b] (0..1)
```

A generator returns one mesh per **slot** (motor: `base bell stator copper magnet shaft adapter`); each slot has a default
finish and `colors` overrides it. A material is `(rgb, specular, shininess, metallic, roughness)` = the MuJoCo `<material>`
attributes (all 0..1; `metallic` / `roughness` exist in MuJoCo 3.7); the named finishes are in
`python/napl/design/visuals/materials.py`. A part without `[visual]` still gets its category's default family
(`visuals.DEFAULTS`, e.g. `motor.bldc` -> `bldc_outrunner`). A part without `[geometry]` is drawn too: the family reads its
dimensions from the part's own params (length / width / height, diameter, `package_*`, `envelope_*` ...) and draws at the
instance frame (the part frame the ports define; boards and packs with their underside at z = 0) on the zero-mass point body the
builder gives such an instance, so physics is unchanged. Where a part publishes no dimension, give an explicit `[visual]` with
`params = { size = [...] }` (sensor_ic) or a family's own params and a cited source. Not drawn: raw materials, OCV curves, wires
(the wire layer) and frame-kit data records.

Generator frames (an element `pos` is only needed when a part deviates): motor mounting face at z = 0, shaft +z; propeller hub
underside at z = 0; gearmotor / stepper / actuator output face at z = 0, body towards -z; boards, packs, pucks, camera / sensor
modules sit with their underside on the underside of the `[geometry]` bounds, centred in x, y; plates, tubes and the `shapes`
fallback are drawn in the part frame from `[geometry]`. Families: `bldc_outrunner propeller lipo_pack cell_18650 cf_tube
board_generic board_esc board_fc board_power board_sbc gnss_puck camera_module sensor_module box_device connector servo_case
gearmotor wheel_tyre stepper_nema qdd_actuator bearing standoff screw heat_insert diabolo_pellet pulley hub_disc shaft_collar
plate_outline shapes` (plus the structure / servo / launcher families listed in `visuals/__init__.py`). Rocket and marine
families (`gens_rocket.py`, `gens_marine.py`, each used by an explicit `[visual]`): `solid_motor body_tube ogive_nose fin_set
landing_leg tvc_gimbal` (`params = { kind = "plate" | "ring" | "cradle" }`) `catamaran_hull ducted_thruster esc_sealed`.

Vendor CAD as a visual: `mesh = "meshes/..."` (binary or ASCII STL, one slot `body`, finish from `colors.body`). Only files whose
licence allows redistribution in a proprietary product belong in the repo (record it in the source's `license`); today that is
only the SO-101 and Koch STLs (Apache-2.0, `meshes/*/LICENSE`). Every other shape is generated.
