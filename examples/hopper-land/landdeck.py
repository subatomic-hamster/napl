"""Deck-relative landing interface of the hopper-land flight computer.

The flight computer lands on a surface that may move. Whatever tells it where that surface is -- RTK moving-baseline GNSS between a base on the deck and the rover on the vehicle, a deck datalink with the
vessel's attitude and motion, a downward lidar -- reaches it as one small record, `DeckState`, a few times per second. `Flight.step(..., deck=DeckState)` (landflight) then
  * follows the deck's horizontal position and velocity (HOVER, DESCENT, FINAL),
  * governs the final sink by the height above the deck surface, with the deck's vertical velocity as feed-forward (relative sink rate `v_sink_min` at touchdown),
  * declares touchdown when the estimated height above the (predicted) surface is below 2 cm.

DeckState is the plug point for the vessel work (the SHIP stage's `napl.cuas.relnav` output): anything that produces `DeckState` objects replaces `DeckLink` below. This module also holds a SCRIPTED
deck used to test the interface now: landscene.add_deck builds a platform on three slides and two hinges, `ScriptedDeck` drives it with heave, roll, pitch and a steady drift (sinusoids with seeded
phases, ESTIMATES of a 12 m vessel in sea state 3-4: heave +-0.3 m at 8 s, roll +-2 deg at 9 s, pitch +-1 deg at 7 s), `DeckLink` plays the datalink with rate, latency and noise.
