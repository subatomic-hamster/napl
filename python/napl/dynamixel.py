"""Virtual DYNAMIXEL Protocol 2.0 serial bus: a pty speaking the X-series protocol, backed by simulated servo devices.

    port = DynamixelPort(sim, servos={1: "/devices/s1", 2: "/devices/s2"}, models={2: "xl330-m288-t"})
    port.device_path        # e.g. /dev/pts/7: open it with unmodified Dynamixel code (dynamixel_sdk, LeRobot, ...)

Sources (fetched 2026-10-07; the e-Manual says it is moving to docs.robotis.com, same content): protocol
https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/dxl/protocol2/ , control tables https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/dxl/x/xl430-w250/ and
https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/dxl/x/xl330-m288/ (XL330-M077-T: https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/dxl/x/xl330-m077/, same
table with other defaults), digest with the CRC table and test vectors: docs/research/dynamixel.md. Models: "xl430-w250-t" (number
1060, default), "xl330-m288-t" (1200), "xl330-m077-t" (1190), chosen per bus id with `models={id: name}`.

Protocol: `FF FF FD 00 | ID | LEN_L LEN_H | INSTR | PARAMS.. | CRC_L CRC_H`, `LEN = len(PARAMS) + 3` counting the stuffed bytes; the
CRC-16 (poly 0x8005, init 0, MSB first, no reflection; e-Manual `update_crc`) covers header .. last parameter (stuffed). Byte
stuffing: every `FF FF FD` after the header in INSTR / PARAMS gets a `FD` appended on TX; on RX the CRC is checked over the received
(stuffed) bytes, then the stuffing is removed. Status `FF FF FD 00 | ID | LEN | 55 | ERR | PARAMS.. | CRC` (ERR bit 7 = Alert while
the Hardware Error Status is not 0; 0x01 Result Fail, 0x02 Instruction Error, 0x03 CRC Error, 0x04 Data Range, 0x05 Data Length,
0x06 Data Limit, 0x07 Access Error). Broadcast ID 0xFE answers only PING, SYNC_READ, BULK_READ (PING in id order; SYNC / BULK READ
in the order of the request); every other instruction is executed silently. Status Return Level (68): 0 = PING only, 1 = PING +
READ (SYNC / BULK READ count as READ), 2 = all. A frame with a bad CRC is not executed; a unicast one to a known id gets a CRC
Error status (the e-Manual lists the error; a real servo's behaviour on a corrupted frame is not documented beyond "waits for the
next header"), a broadcast one nothing. A stalled partial frame is dropped after 50 ms.

Instructions: PING 0x01, READ 0x02, WRITE 0x03, REG_WRITE 0x04 (+ ACTION 0x05, Registered Instruction 69; ACTION without a pending
REG_WRITE = Instruction Error), FACTORY_RESET 0x06 (0xFF all, 0x01 all but ID, 0x02 all but ID and baud; broadcast 0xFF is not
executed, as the e-Manual says; the status goes out first, then the table is reset: RAM and EEPROM, torque off), REBOOT 0x08 (RAM back
to the defaults, EEPROM kept, torque off, Hardware Error Status cleared), CLEAR 0x10 mode 0x01 (Present Position back to one turn,
only while the servo is stopped, else Result Fail; mode 0x02 is Y-series only: Instruction Error), SYNC_READ 0x82, SYNC_WRITE 0x83,
BULK_READ 0x92, BULK_WRITE 0x93. NOT implemented (Instruction Error, silent on broadcast): FAST SYNC / BULK READ 0x8A / 0x9A (one
combined status packet with per-device ERR ID CRC and no stuffing, not needed by the Python SDK's GroupSyncRead / GroupBulkRead),
CONTROL TABLE BACKUP 0x20. A write is validated whole before anything is applied (a real servo may apply a prefix).

Register map (XL430-W250-T; XL330 differences below). S = simulated (reads come from / writes go to the sim), P = stored in the port
only (does not influence the physics; EEPROM / RAM image), R = read-only. A write to an S register becomes a SetAttr on the servo
device (source "dynamixel"). Units are the register units of the e-Manual (pulse = 2 pi / cpr rad, velocity 0.229 rev/min, PWM 0.113 %).

XL330: no 38 on XL430; XL330 adds 38 current limit, 62 PWM slope, 102 goal current; 126 is the present current. Defaults per model
as in the e-Manual (XL430: P 640 D 4000 shutdown 52 temp 70 / 72 ...; M288: P 400 D 0 shutdown 53 ...; M077: D 400, velocity limit
1620). Indirect address / data (168.., 224.., 578.., 634..) are not implemented: undefined addresses give an Access Error.

Gain scales: the device runs `u = (p e + i sum e + d de) / pid_scale` (de, sum per firmware step) with an optional `d_scale`. The
firmware law is PWM = (P / 128) e + (I / 65536) sum e + (D / 16) de with 885 = 100 % duty (e-Manual, e in pulses by inference). With
the device calibrated as pid_scale = 128 x 885 and d_scale = 16 x 885 the P and D registers map 1:1 onto p and d and device
i = I x 128 / 65536 = I / 512. P_SCALE, I_SCALE, D_SCALE are those factors; a calibration that changes the device's pid_scale
changes them. At start-up the register image is the device's actual values (a mapped register keeps the table default when the
device already holds the equivalent value); FACTORY_RESET / REBOOT push the table defaults.

Position semantics (e-Manual): mode 3 Goal Position is 0..4095 within the Min / Max Position Limit (Data Limit Error outside),
the servo stays in its present turn (it does not cross the 0 / 4095 wrap; use a homing offset to put the work range mid-turn);
modes 4 / 5 take +-1,048,575 (Data Range Error) and ignore the limits. Present Position is, per the e-Manual, a continuous 4-byte
value while the torque is off and an absolute 0..4095 value after torque-on in mode 3: this port reports the wrapped value in
mode 3 at all times (deviation). Enabling the torque holds the present position unless a goal was written while it was off.

Hardware error / shutdown: the device's alarm bits (a tick with torque off clears them, conditions that still hold set them
again) are reported in register 70 and as the Alert bit. A bit in Shutdown (63) latches in the port, clears the torque
(register and device) and refuses Torque Enable = 1 with Result Fail until REBOOT (e-Manual: "REBOOT is the only method").

Modelled vs stubbed. Modelled: modes 3 / 4 position (and 5 as extended position), torque, goal, profile velocity, position PID,
PWM limit / goal PWM as the duty limit, voltage / temperature limits and shutdown, present position / velocity / PWM / load /
current / voltage / temperature / moving, homing offset, return delay, status return level, error codes, all instructions above.
Stubbed (stored with the right default, size, access and range; no physics): Operating Modes 0 / 1 / 16 (the device has a position
firmware only: the register accepts them, Torque Enable = 1 is then refused with Result Fail), Goal Current / Current Limit (the
device's i_limit is config-only: mode 5 is position mode with the duty limit), Goal Velocity, velocity PI, feedforward gains,
Profile Acceleration (profile = velocity-limited ramp, no acceleration limit), Drive Mode, Bus Watchdog, Secondary ID, Protocol Type,
Startup Configuration, PWM Slope, velocity trajectory, moving status following-error bit, LED, Moving Threshold only for register 122.
Every SetAttr goes through the command bus with source "dynamixel", so a session with a Host log replays exactly (the log holds the
writes and the Steps; the pty traffic itself and its wall-clock timing are not part of it).
Timing: with `realtime=True` (the Sim running at Host rate 1) each byte of a request and of a status takes 10 / baud s of wall
clock and each status additionally waits the servo's `return delay x 2 us`; the register is read after the request has arrived.
