// The viewer: a GLFW window with a Vulkan swapchain (WindowRenderer) and a Dear ImGui overlay (scene tree, inspector with
// SI units, pause/run/step/rate). It runs on the calling thread -- GLFW needs the main thread on macOS -- while the Host's
// own thread runs the simulation. The viewer never touches the World: it draws Host::take_frame() snapshots, and every
// UI action is an ordinary bus command (napl.Envelope with source "viewer") sent through Host::submit(), so it is
// capability-checked, logged and replayable like any other client's.
