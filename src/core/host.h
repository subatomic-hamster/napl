// Host: owns a World on its own thread; the only thread that ever touches the World.
// Clients submit raw napl.Envelope bytes from any thread (MPSC queue) and get the napl.Reply back.
// The queue is drained only at tick boundaries. The Host starts paused; Run{rate} free-runs one tick at
// a time paced to rate sim-seconds per wall-second (0 = as fast as possible), Pause freezes the tick
// (the thread then blocks on the queue). Run/Pause are logged like any control command, so the log
// (World::log, replay()) reproduces the session, including the ticks advanced between commands.
//
// Viewers read through take_frame(): the sim thread copies the render state (poses, plus the visuals when the scene
// changed) into a back buffer when a frame was requested, the viewer swaps it out. The viewer never touches the World.
